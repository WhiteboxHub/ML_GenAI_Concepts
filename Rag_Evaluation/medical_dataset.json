HIV attacks the body through three disease\nprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\nvous system dysfunction.\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\nthe body\u2019s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is\nnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency\nresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein called\nCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain\nsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4\ncells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the\nvirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor\ncalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of\nthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-\nlar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showed\nthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)",

Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema-\nture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri-\nal extrasystole.\nDescription\nAn AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the\nnormal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional-\nly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequence\nand then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware of\nthe event.\nCauses and symptoms\nAs people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre-\nquently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB may\nbe triggered or increased by stress, caffeine, smoking,\nand some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrine\nor pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci-\ndence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the result\nof an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reduced\nblood supply to that area of the heart.",
