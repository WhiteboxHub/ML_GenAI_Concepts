 Indeep learning,fine-tuningis an approach totransfer learningin which the parameters of a pre-trainedneural networkmodel are trained on new data.[1]Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network, or on only a subset of itslayers, in which case the layers that are not being fine-tuned are "frozen" (i.e., not changed duringbackpropagation).[2]A model may also be augmented with "adapters" that consist of far fewer parameters than the original model, and fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient way by tuning the weights of the adapters and leaving the rest of the model's weights frozen.[3] For some architectures, such asconvolutional neural networks, it is common to keep the earlier layers (those closest to the input layer) frozen, as they capture lower-levelfeatures, while later layers often discern high-level features that can be more related to the task that the model is trained on.[2][4] Models that are pre-trained on large, general corpora are usually fine-tuned by reusing their parameters as a starting point and adding a task-specific layer trained from scratch.[5]Fine-tuning the full model is also common and often yields better results, but is more computationally expensive.[6] Fine-tuning is typically accomplished viasupervised learning, but there are also techniques to fine-tune a model usingweak supervision.[7]Fine-tuning can be combined with areinforcement learning from human feedback-basedobjectiveto produce language models such asChatGPT(a fine-tuned version ofGPT-3) andSparrow.[8][9] Fine-tuning can degrade a model's robustness todistribution shifts.[10][11]One mitigation is to linearly interpolate a fine-tuned model's weights with the weights of the original model, which can greatly increase out-of-distribution performance while largely retaining the in-distribution performance of the fine-tuned model.[12] Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is an adapter-based technique for efficiently fine-tuning models. The basic idea is to design a low-rankmatrix that is then added to the original matrix.[13]An adapter, in this context, is a collection of low-rank matrices which, when added to a base model, produces a fine-tuned model. It allows for performance that approaches full-model fine-tuning with less space requirement. A language model with billions of parameters may be LoRA fine-tuned with only several millions of parameters. LoRA-based fine-tuning has become popular in theStable Diffusioncommunity.[14]Support for LoRA was integrated into the Diffusers library fromHugging Face.[15]Support for LoRA and similar techniques is also available for a wide range of other models through Hugging Face's Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) package.[16] Representation fine-tuning (ReFT) is a novel technique developed by researchers atStanford Universityaimed at fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by modifying less than 1% of their representations. Unlike traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which mainly focus on updating weights, ReFT targets specific parts of the model relevant to the task being fine-tuned. This approach is based on the understanding that deep learning models encode rich semantic information in their representations, suggesting that modifying representations might be a more effective strategy than updating weights.[17] ReFT methods operate on a frozen base model and learn task-specific interventions on hidden representations and train interventions that manipulate a small fraction of model representations to steer model behaviors towards solving downstream tasks at inference time. One specific method within the ReFT family is Low-rank Linear Subspace ReFT (LoReFT), which intervenes on hidden representations in the linear subspace spanned by a low-rank projection matrix.[17]LoReFT can be seen as the representation-based equivalent of Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). Fine-tuning is common innatural language processing(NLP), especially in the domain oflanguage modeling.Large language modelslikeOpenAI's series ofGPT foundation modelscan be fine-tuned on data for specific downstream NLP tasks (tasks that use a pre-trained model) to improve performance over the unmodified pre-trained model.[6] Commercially-offered large language models can sometimes be fine-tuned if the provider offers a fine-tuning API. As of June 19, 2023, language model fine-tuning APIs are offered byOpenAIandMicrosoft Azure's Azure OpenAI Service for a subset of their models, as well as byGoogle Cloud Platformfor some of theirPaLMmodels, and by others.[18][19][20]Not all commercial models currently[when?]support fine-tuning. Companies such asMeta(LlamaLLMfamily),Alibaba(Qwen LLM family) andMistral AI(Mixtral) have published open source large language models with different sizes on GitHub, which can be fine-tuned. Open-source models can be advantageous for companies in terms of data security, because they can control where the model is hosted.

 [2]A model may also be augmented with "adapters" that consist of far fewer parameters than the original model, and fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient way by tuning the weights of the adapters and leaving the rest of the model's weights frozen. [10][11]One mitigation is to linearly interpolate a fine-tuned model's weights with the weights of the original model, which can greatly increase out-of-distribution performance while largely retaining the in-distribution performance of the fine-tuned model.
