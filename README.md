## Introduction
This repository provides hands-on implementations and tutorials on various concepts in Generative AI. Each topic is covered in detail, and the corresponding code is organized into specific folders. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find this repository useful to understand and build generative models.

## Folder Structure

###  Language Models
**Folder**: `language_models/`

This folder contains code implementations for various foundational language models (e.g., GPT, BERT) used for generative tasks. Learn how to generate text, complete sentences, and more using language models.

###  Text Summarization
**Folder**: `Text_Summarization/`

Explore different approaches to text Summarization & classification, such as:
- using NLTK ( Natural Language Toolkit)
- using LLM (BART Model)
- The folder contains readme file that tells how to RUN the Code and what are the prerequisite needed for the code to RUN.

###  Fine-Tuning Models
**Folder**: `fine_tuning/`

Learn how to fine-tune pre-trained models on custom datasets for specific tasks:
- Fine-tuning GPT for domain-specific text generation
- Adapting image generation models for custom styles or concepts

###  Embeddings and Vector Databases
**Folder**: `embeddings_vector_db/`

Explore the world of embeddings and how to store them in vector databases:
- Generating embeddings for text, images, or audio
- Using vector databases like Pinecone, FAISS, or pgvector to store and retrieve embeddings

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Folder**: `retrieval_augmented_generation/`

This section demonstrates how to implement RAG systems by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models:
- Querying knowledge bases
- RAG architectures with document retrieval


###  Evaluation Metrics
**Folder**: `evaluation_metrics/`

Evaluation is critical in GenAI tasks. This folder contains scripts to measure:
- Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and other text evaluation metrics
- Inception score, FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) for images
- Audio quality metrics for TTS and music generation


## Usage

Each folder contains individual `README.md` files explaining how to run the code for that specific topic.
