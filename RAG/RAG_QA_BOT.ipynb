Located between Phoenix and Tucson — and within easy reach of our Silicon Valley headquarters — the Casa Grande offered close proximity to critical utilities, an established transportation system, and strong support from state and local governments.This facility is the first greenfield — or purpose-built — EV factory in North America. Designed to our exact specifications, it is being built with such efficiency and speed that we will complete construction of its first phase a mere 12 months after breaking ground. Outfitted with the world’s most advanced production line equipment, the factory will have the initial capacity to produce 10,000 cars a year — and over 300,000 annually with planned expansion.
